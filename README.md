# Embedded Software Engineering RoadMap 2018

> This is a work in progress... permanently

Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become an embedded software engineer. I made these charts to simplify the perspective of learning several technologies.

If you think that these can be improved in anyway, please start an issue or pull request, I’ll be maintaining and updating this repository yearly, the source files can be edited using [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.com/download/)
